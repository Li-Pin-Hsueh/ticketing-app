1. Use setTimeout()
  - Timer stored in memory. If service restarts, all timers are lost
2. Don't ack until time to emit.
  - Rely on NATS redelivery mechanism. Seems wired...
3. Use "Bull JS" library, it will set a reminder and store a list of jobs inside Redis Server
  - Redis server is a in-memory database.
